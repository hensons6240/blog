# Business Inventions for the Future.

## Content
In this entry, we talk about what future inventions or gadgets that we could come up with that would positively affect the future of our topics where mine was 'Business' as well as how we finalized our content page so its ready for our freedom project. For my topic of 'Business' it was actually quite challenging to come up an invention because of how broad my topic was. I came up with the idea of a "Flying Box" which helps you carry stuff and allows you to be at ease and focus on other stuff instead of worrying about your belongings weighing you down or getting stolen. Carrying heavy things can lead to health disadvantages like [backpain](https://www.discspine.com/back-stories/lower-back-pain-from-lifting-something-heavy/).

During this time, we also had to work on our [content.md](https://github.com/hensons6240/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/content.md) where we organized all our content throughout our many steps. Alongside our invention, we had to add bulletpoints and properly organize our content about existing software and gadgets as well as a section on our own invention.

## Engineering Design Progress
I am currently on the Create a prototype portion of our project as the fact that I only have a single invention because of the difficult around finding multiple allowed me to pick the most promising solution, my only solution. Although we haven't went into much detail, I plan on figuring out ways so that my invention the "Flying Box" can be more affective then the backpack as although the idea makes it way better, it may have issues elsewhere. I do believe its sounds way better than a backpack, however, for it to worthwhile, it has to be better built as some more major problems it has is either traffic or energy or how it actually flies because these are all parts that allow it to actually work.

## Skills
**Consideration** - I believe to have earned the skill of consideration as I took into detail of how this could benefit people and tried fitting it in a way that could benefit the needy as well as shown in my  [content.md](https://github.com/hensons6240/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/content.md). It involved ways to help the disabled and also considered enviornmental damage.

**Creativity** -  The idea of coming up an invention especially in this day and age was very challenging. Most ideas were taken and many ideas are very similair. Even now I based my invention on a need and existing technology, the drone to come up with this. Although the name of 'Flying Box' sounds very basic and probably should be changed, the addons and other utility I added made it a lot more interesting I believe.

## Summary
I look forward to growing my invention as I believe there is a lot I can add to make it a lot more efficient. Although it may take a lot more parts to make it worthwhile, looking at existing issues of its counterparts may be able to help me.
