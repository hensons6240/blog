## Content
In this entry, we talk about what future inventions or gadgets that we could come up with that would positively affect the future of our topics where mine was 'Business' as well as how we finalized our content page so its ready for our freedom project. For my topic of 'Business' it was actually quite challenging to come up an invention because of how broad my topic was. I came up with the idea of a "Flying Box" where it would help you carry our loads which could vary depening on your profession and especially in jobs like business, you have to carry a lot especially if you do in-person work. It helps you carry stuff (obviously) and allows you to be at ease and focus on other stuff instead of worrying about your belongings weighing you down or getting stolen. 

During this time, we also had to work on our content.md where we organized all our content throughout our many steps. Alongside our invention, we had to add bulletpoints and properly organize our content: exisitng software: existing gadgets that we could properly use it when we actually start on our future website.
