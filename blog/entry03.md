# Business Inventions for the Future.
## Content
In this entry, we talk about what future inventions or gadgets that we could come up with that would positively affect the future of our topics where mine was 'Business' as well as how we finalized our content page so its ready for our freedom project. For my topic of 'Business' it was actually quite challenging to come up an invention because of how broad my topic was. I came up with the idea of a "Flying Box" which helps you carry stuff and allows you to be at ease and focus on other stuff instead of worrying about your belongings weighing you down or getting stolen. Carrying heavy things can lead to health disadvantages like [backpain](https://www.discspine.com/back-stories/lower-back-pain-from-lifting-something-heavy/).

During this time, we also had to work on our [content.md](https://github.com/hensons6240/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/content.md) where we organized all our content throughout our many steps. Alongside our invention, we had to add bulletpoints and properly organize our content about existing software and gadgets as well as a section on our own invention.
